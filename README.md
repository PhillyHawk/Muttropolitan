 ## Contribution

 my role with this group was to add in the Google Map API.<br>
 I was able to add two maps onto the site.<br>
 Although I was unable to incorperate the Foursquare API to populate the markers.<br>
 This is a project that I will revisit to adjust those maps to operate the way I initially intendend them to work.
